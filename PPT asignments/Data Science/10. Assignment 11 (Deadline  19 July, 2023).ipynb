    "Word embeddings are a type of representation that captures the semantic meaning of words. They are typically learned from a large corpus of text, and they represent each word as a vector of real numbers. The vector representation of a word captures the meaning of the word in terms of its relationship to other words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different ways to learn word embeddings. One common approach is to use a technique called word2vec. Word2vec works by predicting the context of a word based on its surrounding words. For example, if the word \"cat\" is often surrounded by the words \"dog\", \"meow\", and \"fur\", then the word \"cat\" will be associated with these words in the word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common approach to learning word embeddings is to use a technique called GloVe. GloVe works by predicting the co-occurrence of words. For example, if the word \"cat\" often occurs with the word \"dog\", then the word \"cat\" will be associated with the word \"dog\" in the word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once word embeddings have been learned, they can be used to represent text in a way that captures the semantic meaning of the words. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the ways that word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Word similarity: Word embeddings can be used to measure the similarity between words. This is done by calculating the distance between the word vectors. Words that are similar in meaning will have vectors that are close together in space.\n",
    "Word analogy: Word embeddings can be used to solve word analogy problems. A word analogy problem is a problem that asks for the word that completes a relationship between two other words. For example, the word analogy \"king is to queen as man is to ___\" can be solved by using word embeddings to find the word that is most similar to \"queen\" in the context of \"king\".\n",
    "Text classification: Word embeddings can be used to classify text into different categories. This is done by training a machine learning model on a dataset of labeled text. The model learns to associate the word vectors with the different categories, and it can then be used to classify new text.\n",
    "Overall, word embeddings are a powerful tool that can be used to capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing. They are a valuable asset for a variety of natural language processing tasks.\n",
